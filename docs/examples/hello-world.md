title: Hello World pipeline

A single job is the simplest form of pipeline.

<div>
  <div style="position:relative;padding-top:40%;">
    <iframe src="https://ci.concourse-ci.org/teams/examples/pipelines/job" allowfullscreen
      style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0"></iframe>
  </div>
</div>

While this is less of an example pipeline, this is a simple introduction to a critical primitive to form pipelines.

Also, due to the fact that there are minimal external factors ([Resources](https://concourse-ci.org/resources.html)) for
the system to check and resolve, this is often used to test overall system health.

## Pipeline Configuration

```yaml linenums="1"
---
jobs:
  - name: job
    public: true
    plan:
      - task: simple-task
        config:
          platform: linux
          image_resource:
            type: registry-image
            source: { repository: busybox }
          run:
            path: echo
            args: [ "Hello world!" ]
```
