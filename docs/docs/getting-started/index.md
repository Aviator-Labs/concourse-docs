title: Getting Started
---

This tutorial will guide you through the basics of creating Concourse pipelines. You will use a local instance of
Concourse running on your machine to run pipelines.

Before getting started you should have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

This tutorial assumes you understand what Linux containers are and how to work with them. If you know what a Dockerfile
is and how to make your own then you're probably good to jump into this tutorial. If you're not familiar with Linux
containers then you may want to [get started with Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) first before diving into
this tutorial.

It will also help if you know how to read YAML. We have a
quick [Intro to YAML](https://concourse-ci.org/config-basics.html#intro-to-yaml) if you're not familiar with the syntax.
